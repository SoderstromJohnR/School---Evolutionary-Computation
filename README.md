Project 1 forms the basis for projects 2 and 4, while 3 is a little different. Each has their own readme that goes into more detail.

## Project 1
Evolutionary algorithm. Taking vectors in the form (x, y, z) where each is a real number, try to reach the lowest possible value in x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup>.

## Project 2
Genetic algorithm. As Project 1, but replace x, y, and z with bitstrings. Try to reach the lowest possible value as before, represented by bitstrings of nothing but 0.

## Project 3
Knapsack problem. Given objects with different weights and values as well as a limited capacity, try to find the greatest possible value without going over capacity for weight.

## Project 4
Jaya algorithm. As Project 1, but change the process for determining the next generation of solutions/vectors.
